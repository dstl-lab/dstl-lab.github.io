Applications for Fall 2024 are now closed. Our next recruitment will happen at the start of Fall 2025. The content below was posted for Fall 2024, but won't change too much for Fall 2025.

<!-- <a href="https://forms.gle/Xpez96nbGYmPjYF8A" target="_blank"><button class="apply-button">Apply here!</button></a> -->

Applications to join the DSTL Lab are now open for Fall 2024! We invite
undergraduate students of all years to apply. Here's what to expect.

**Info session:** We held an information session from 2-3pm on October 10th,
2024 in the HDSI MPR. Thanks to those of you who came out! [The recording is
available here](https://youtu.be/e2-H61iNEtY)

**The application process:** Written applications are due by 11:59pm October 11.
We will interview candidates between October 16-18, and final decisions will be
made by October 25.

**Qualifications:** In our research group, we think about teaching data science
and create software to make that process better for instructors. We're looking
for teammates who:

- Love teaching! We spend lots of time thinking about teaching and learning data
  science to make that process better for both instructors and students.
- Are excellent programmers. We also spend lots of time writing code to create
  new tools that instructors and students can use in the data science classroom.
  We write Python and JavaScript.

**Commitment:** We are looking for teammates who can commit at least 10 hours
per week for the upcoming academic year from Oct. 29, 2024 to June 6, 2025.

**What will I work on?** This year, the lab will split into 3 teams working on
separate projects. We'll meet once per week to update each other on project
status. Our projects this year are really exciting, in our humble opinion,
ranging from a study on instructor GenAI usage via a collaboration with Google
to designing new LLM-based tools for data science.
