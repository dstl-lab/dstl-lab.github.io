Applications to join the DSTL Lab are now open for Fall 2025! We invite
undergraduate and Masters students of all years to apply. Here's what to expect.

**Info session:** We held an information session from 11am-12pm on October 2nd
in the HDSI MPR. [Recording of the info session][recording] and [slides][slides]
are available.

**The application process:** Written applications are due by 11:59pm October 3rd.
We will interview candidates between October 8-10, and final decisions will be
made by October 14.

**Qualifications:** In our research group, we think about teaching data science
and create software to make that process better for instructors. We're looking
for teammates who:

- Love teaching! We spend lots of time thinking about teaching and learning data
  science to make that process better for both instructors and students.
- Enjoy programming. We also spend lots of time writing code to create
  new tools that instructors and students can use in the data science classroom.
  We primarily write Python and JavaScript.

**Commitment:** We are looking for teammates who can commit at least 10 hours
per week for the upcoming academic year from Oct. 14, 2025 to June 7, 2026.

**What will I work on?** This year, the lab will split into 3 teams working on
separate projects. We'll meet once per week to update each other on project
status. Our projects this year will be broadly centered around using GenAI for
teaching programming and data science, including deploying an AI tutor for DSC
10 and building a dashboard for instructors to understand student chatbot logs.
