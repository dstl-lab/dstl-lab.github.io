The Data Science Teaching and Learning Lab (DSTL, pronounced "distill") at UCSD
conducts research studies and prototypes novel tools for teaching and learning
data science. The overarching goal of our group is to discover how instructors
use (or struggle to use!) software tools to accomplish the many tasks of
teaching, and design new tools that can improve the lives of data science
instructors everywhere.

{% comment %}
Teaching data science is hard! Instructors design learning
materials, oversee course staff, maintain infrastructure, and integrate new
discoveries in an rapidly-evolving field, all under the constraints of their
academic calendar.

**What we do:** Our group applies methods from [Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI)][hci] to understand how instructors use software by conducting interviews
and usability studies. We also build and maintain software tools like [Pandas
Tutor][pt], used by over 20,000 people per year.
